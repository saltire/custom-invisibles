# Custom Invisibles

Toggle and customize invisible characters individually.

The default Atom settings have a single "Show Invisibles" option to toggle all invisible characters.
These include:

- Carriage return: ¤
- Line break: ¬
- Leading space: ·
- Leading tab: »

With this package you can turn any of these on and off individually,
or replace them with custom characters.
